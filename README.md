DevWatch transforms GNOME from a generic desktop into a **developer-aware operating layer** that understands your projects, tracks their runtime behavior, and eliminates common workflow friction — directly from the panel.

---

## Why DevWatch?

Linux developers think in terms of **projects, services, ports, and builds** — not raw PIDs and CPU graphs.

Yet every existing tool (`htop`, `lsof`, GNOME System Monitor) is **process-oriented**, not **project-oriented**.

DevWatch fills that gap by mapping running system processes back to your development projects, surfacing exactly the runtime intelligence you actually need without ever leaving the desktop.

| Without DevWatch | With DevWatch |
|---|---|
| `lsof -i :3000` in terminal | See `Port 3000 → backend-api` in panel |
| `ps aux \| grep node` | Project cluster with all associated processes |
| Kill processes one by one | One-click "Clean orphans" |
| Rebuild whole dev env after reboot | Restore snapshot in seconds |
| No insight into build resource cost | Last 5 builds: avg time, peak RAM, trend |

---

## Features

### Pillar 1 — Project-Aware Process Intelligence
- Detects active project via focused window, terminal CWD, and `git` root
- Groups running processes by project directory
- Shows per-project aggregate CPU, memory, and runtime

### Pillar 2 — Intelligent Port & Service Control
- Live monitoring of all listening ports via `ss -tulnp`
- Conflict detection with contextual GNOME notifications
- One-click kill, copy PID, open terminal at project root

### Pillar 3 — Dev Environment Cleanup Engine
- Identifies zombie and orphaned dev processes (detached, idle, parentless)
- Single-click "Clean Dev State" with optional confirmation list

### Pillar 4 — Dev Session Snapshot & Restore
- Captures running processes, ports, active git branches
- Restores full dev environment after reboot

### Pillar 5 — Dev Performance Intelligence
- Detects active builds (`npm`, `cargo`, `make`, `gradle`, `go build`, …)
- Records peak CPU/RAM per build, trends over the last 5 runs

---

## Design Principles

- **Project-centric, not process-centric**
- **Minimal UI, maximum clarity** — text-first, no graphs unless necessary
- **Local-only, privacy-first** — no cloud, no telemetry, no analytics
- **Non-intrusive** — async polling, low memory footprint
- **Developer workflow acceleration** — reduce terminal round-trips

---

## Requirements

| Requirement | Version |
|---|---|
| GNOME Shell | 45 or newer |
| GJS | Bundled with GNOME Shell |
| `ss` (socket statistics) | Part of `iproute2` |
| `git` | Any recent version |

---

## Installation

### From Source (Development)

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Adithya-Balan/DevWatch.git
cd DevWatch

# 2. Symlink into GNOME's extension directory
make link

# 3. Log out and log back in (required once on GNOME Wayland)
#    Then enable the extension:
gnome-extensions enable devwatch@github.io
```

### Verify it loaded

```bash
gnome-extensions info devwatch@github.io
```

You should see `● DevWatch` appear in the top-right panel area.

### Makefile Targets

```bash
make link     # Symlink project files into GNOME extension dir (run after adding files)
make enable   # Enable the extension
make disable  # Disable the extension
make pack     # Build distributable .zip
make log      # Tail GNOME Shell logs (your console.log() appears here)
make nested   # Launch a nested Wayland GNOME session for safe testing
make status   # Show gnome-extensions info
```

### Viewing Logs

```bash
make log
# or
journalctl -f -o cat /usr/bin/gnome-shell
```

### Testing in a Nested Session (Safe — won't crash your desktop)

```bash
make nested
# Inside the nested window, open a terminal and:
gnome-extensions enable devwatch@github.io
```

## Architecture Notes

- **Runtime:** GJS (GNOME JavaScript) with native ES Modules (GNOME 45+ ESM syntax)
- **UI toolkit:** St (Shell Toolkit) + Clutter actors
- **Async model:** `Gio.Subprocess` with `_promisify` — never blocking the main loop
- **Data sources:** `/proc` filesystem + `ss`, `git` CLI tools
- **Storage:** `~/.local/share/devwatch/` — snapshots and build history
- **No elevated privileges required**
